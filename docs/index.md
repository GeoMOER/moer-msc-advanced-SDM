Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a key competence for ecogeographical research and applied nature conservation. 
It allows researchers to estimate current distributions of species and to also predict their future distributions under climate change scenarios. However, SDM is a dynamic field characterized by rapid advancements and many uncertainties.

This course will go beyond the basic SDM knowledge and will delve into all the small and very specific challenges it presents. Participants will gain ability in generating virtual species, critically evaluating the selection of environmental predictors, identifying knowledge gaps in the field, and independently constructing and fine-tune SDMs. The main focus of the course will be on generating an experimental research setup in which we will tackle some of the uncertainties. 


# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should

* be familiar with virtual species and gained the ability to generate them.
* have explored the impact of selecting environmental predictors on SDM.
* be able to identified gaps in current knowledge within a specific field of research.
* be able to independently constructed your own SDMs.
* engage with various modeling strategies including tuning, variable selection, training, testing, and validation techniques.
* have designed, executed, and analyzed your own scientific experiments.
* have developed awareness regarding the capabilities and limitations of SDMs.


# Course features

This course is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.

This course will take place in the classroom (**F 14 | 00A19**). The first session will take place **on Thursday 24.04.2025 at 09:15 am**.
Course material will be provided in the [Ilias course environment](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php/crs/4304496){:target="_blank"} (only accessible for members of the course who are logged-in into Ilias).

# Deliverables

The course grading will be based on on your final SDM project.




# Preparation and prerequisites

Knowledge of R and of handling spatial data is beneficial. Initial experience with species distribution modeling is helpful, for example from our basic [species distribution modeling course](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/).
All software needed for this course is free and open source.

If you have no experience with R we highly recommend the base R course, 
which can be found [here](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/){:target="_blank"}.
