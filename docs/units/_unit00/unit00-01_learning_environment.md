This course is intended as a blended learning module, although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study only, too.

The sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person 
at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg,
and the others virtually. The link to the virtual meeting room will be provided be the instructors in the first session and can also be found in Ilias (see below).



## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help.
The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. 
Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.

### Structure of the HTML Learning Environment

The HTML learning environment is organized into four distinct modules, each designed to guide you through various aspects of the course.

1. **LM (Learning Material)**: This module provides the theoretical background, supplementary information, and all the essential details you need to understand the concepts covered in the course. It serves as the foundation for the practical exercises you'll complete later.

2. **EX (Exercises)**: These are practical sessions where you apply the concepts discussed in the learning material. Through hands-on coding, youâ€™ll create the elements we've covered in theory, reinforcing your understanding and skill.

3. **EX-A (Advanced Exercises)**: These exercises are intended for advanced participants and are optional for bachelor-level students. Given the diverse skill levels of the course participants, these exercises provide additional challenges for those who wish to deepen their knowledge and capabilities.

4. **A (Assignments)**: These are out-of-class exercises that require you to apply the course material in a more comprehensive way. Assignments are meant to test your understanding and ability to transfer the skills learned in the course. You must upload your completed assignments to ILIAS (unless otherwise stated) by the beginning of the next session.


## Flexible learning with deadlines

You will use the learning material provided in the HTML learning environment(s) for solving the given assignment tasks.
The synchronous sessions will be used for discussing the assignments.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), 
but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.

## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. 
We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents.
The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_3203176){:target="_blank"}.
Note that you have to log in with your student account. 
There is also a forum in Ilias, which you can use for getting in touch with your fellow students.
