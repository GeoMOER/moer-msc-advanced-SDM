This exercise is designed to deepen your understanding of current methodological challenges in species distribution modeling (SDM) and to help you identify research gaps relevant to your project.

### Instructions
1. **Read the following commentary** to familiarize yourself with the conceptual and practical challenges associated with presence-only SDMs:

	Leroy, B. (2023). Choosing presence-only species distribution models. Journal of Biogeography, 50(1), 247–250. [https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14505]( https://doi.org/10.1111/jbi.14505)

1. Then, **read the mentioned benchmark** study by Valavi et al. 2022 this will give you a first impression on how a methodological comparison study could look like:

	Valavi, R., Guillera‐Arroita, G., Lahoz‐Monfort, J. J., & Elith, J. (2022). Predictive performance of presence‐only species distribution models: A benchmark study with reproducible code. Ecological Monographs, 92(1), e01486. [https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1486]( https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1486)

3. Try to draw a rough flowchart of the modeling workflow of the paper that they used. You can use either use pen and paper, powerpoint, [Canva](https://www.canva.com/), [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) or something similar.
