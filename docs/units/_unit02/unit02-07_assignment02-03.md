In this assignment we will use everything we have learnt so far to create virtual species. We will use the NLMs as environmental variables and the different functionalities from the `virtualspecies` R package to create virtual species for each of your previously designed “countries”.

Please do the following exercises until the next session:

1. You may choose to work individually or in teams of up to two people.
1. Use the 12 NLMs you prepared in the last exercise as environmental variables.
1. create in total 5 virtual species
	* Create three random species with 3 to 5 environmental variables, setting the niche breadth once to `wide`, once to `any`, and once to `narrow`.
	* …
1. Give each species a name (e.g., species1, species2, species3, …)
1. Save the virtual species objects as .RDS files to keep all the different 
1. Zip all species together in a `.zip` file and upload them to ILIAS along with a `PDF` file that briefly describes your species (e.g., niche breadth, used variables, response functions of the species to the environment…).


**Note:** When you upload your data make sure you add both your names if you work in teams.
