In this unit, you'll learn how to create your own environmental data and generate virtual species for modeling purposes. This allows for comprehensive comparison of species distribution models.

In this course, we aim to assess how well species distribution models (SDMs) perform under various conditions. A key requirement for SDM development is the availability of species occurrence data. While platforms like GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) offer real-world occurrence data, environmental variables commonly come from sources such as WorldClim, which provides climate data.

To compare different species distribution models, there is a benchmark dataset consisting of over 200 anonymized species from six regions around the world. However, the test data provided in this dataset are presence-absence data.


These datasets are helpful but limited, as they offer no direct way to compare predicted distributions against actual, real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation and better evaluate model quality, we will use artificially generated data in this course.

By using simulated data, we can not only calculate performance metrics based on presence-absence information but also directly compare the modeled species distribution with its "true" known distribution. This is why we will work with **virtual species** in this unit.

### Virtual Species and artificial landscapes

irtual species are generated by calculating a probability of occurrence based on environmental variables. A commonly used environmental dataset for this is WorldClim, which provides global climate data (see Leroy et al., 2016). However, in real-world scenarios, these environmental variables often provide only an incomplete picture of species distributions (Bale et al., 2002). Species distributions are influenced not only by natural conditions like climate but also by human activities and other non-environmental factors.

To address these complexities, we will use artificially generated environmental variables in this course. Specifically, we will employ neutral landscape models (NLMs), which are algorithms designed to simulate landscapes. Originally developed as null models for studying landscape-scale ecological processes, NLMs now have numerous applications, including the simulation of landscapes for virtual species (Sciaini et al., 2018; Grimmett et al., 2021).

### Neutral Landscape Models (NLMs)

n this course, we will use the **NLMR** package in R, which offers a wide array of models for generating artificial landscapes. These include, but are not limited to, the following types of NLMs (Sciaini et al., 2018):

Random NLMs: Generate completely random landscapes.
*Distance Gradient NLMs: Simulate landscapes with a gradient effect based on distance.
*Linear Gradient NLMs: Create landscapes with linear environmental gradients.
*Gaussian Random Field Models: Model landscapes with complex spatial autocorrelation.

These NLMs can also be combined or manipulated to create more complex and realistic environments for testing species distribution models. By leveraging these landscapes, we can simulate various ecological scenarios and evaluate how well SDMs perform under each condition
