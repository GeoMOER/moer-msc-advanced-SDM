This document outlines essential concepts that shape species distribution and their interactions with the environment. Gaining a deeper understanding of these topics is crucial for developing effective species distribution models. Some of these terms will recur throughout the course, so it is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with them.

### **Niche Breadth**

Niche breadth refers to the range of environmental conditions and resources a species can utilize. A species with a **broad niche** (generalist) can thrive in a variety of conditions and use diverse resources, while a **narrow niche** (specialist) is restricted to specific conditions and resources. Niche breadth influences species distribution, resilience to environmental changes, and competitive interactions.

### **Sampling Strategy**

A well-designed sampling strategy ensures accurate ecological data collection. Common strategies include:

- **Random Sampling**: Every location has an equal chance of being sampled, reducing bias.
- **Systematic Sampling**: Regular intervals are used, ensuring even coverage of an area.
- **Stratified Sampling**: The study area is divided into homogeneous subregions to capture variability.
- **Adaptive Sampling**: Sampling effort increases where species presence is detected, improving efficiency in heterogeneous environments.
  The choice of sampling strategy affects species distribution models and ecological inferences.

### **Dispersal**

Dispersal is the movement of individuals from their birthplace to new locations, influencing species distribution patterns. Dispersal mechanisms include:

- **Passive Dispersal**: Transport via wind, water, or other organisms (e.g., seeds carried by wind or animals).
- **Active Dispersal**: Organisms move by their own means (e.g., birds flying, mammals migrating).
- **Human-mediated Dispersal**: Anthropogenic activities, such as trade and habitat fragmentation, alter natural dispersal patterns.
  Dispersal ability affects colonization success, genetic diversity, and responses to environmental change.

### **Suitable Habitat: Where Are They Really?**

Species distributions do not always align with suitable habitat predictions due to factors such as dispersal limitations, species interactions, and historical biogeography. Key concepts include:

- **Realized vs. Fundamental Niche**: The fundamental niche represents the full range of conditions where a species *could* survive, whereas the realized niche is where it *actually* exists, constrained by competition and other factors.
- **Habitat Connectivity**: The presence of ecological corridors or barriers affects species movement and persistence.
- **Historical Factors**: Past climatic events and geological processes shape current distributions.
  Understanding species presence versus habitat suitability helps refine distribution models.

### **Suitability, Probability, and Presence-Absence Data**

- **Habitat Suitability Models (HSMs)** predict the likelihood of species occurrence based on environmental variables.
- **Probability of Occurrence**: Derived from statistical models, indicating the chance of finding a species at a given location.
- **Presence-Absence (PA) Data**: Used in species distribution models, though absences can be due to non-detection rather than true absence.
- **Thresholds**: Probability values must often be converted into binary presence-absence predictions for practical applications.
  Reliable suitability assessments improve conservation planning and biodiversity management.

### **Abiotic and Biotic Factors**

- **Abiotic Factors**: Non-living environmental conditions affecting species distribution (e.g., temperature, precipitation, soil type, salinity, elevation).
- **Biotic Factors**: Interactions with other organisms, including predation, competition, mutualism, and disease.
- **Interaction Effects**: Abiotic and biotic factors often interact; for example, temperature can influence competition outcomes among species.
  Accurately incorporating both factors is essential for robust species distribution models.

### **Fitness**

Fitness is an organismâ€™s ability to survive and reproduce in its environment. It is influenced by:

- **Environmental Conditions**: Optimal conditions enhance survival and reproduction.
- **Genetic Adaptation**: Populations evolve traits suited to their habitats.
- **Resource Availability**: Access to food, mates, and shelter directly impacts fitness.
  Fitness landscapes help predict species distribution by identifying areas with favorable conditions for reproduction and survival.

### **Environmental and Geographic Space**

- **Environmental Space**: Defined by ecological variables (e.g., climate, soil, resource availability) that determine species viability.
- **Geographic Space**: The actual physical locations where species occur.
- **Species Distribution Models (SDMs)**: Link environmental space to geographic space, predicting species occurrences based on ecological tolerances.
  Understanding the distinction helps refine habitat suitability assessments and conservation efforts.

This material provides foundational knowledge to support species distribution studies and ecological modeling efforts.
