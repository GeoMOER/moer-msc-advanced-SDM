Start learning (or recap) the essentials for working with R and RStudio to create species distribution models.

<!--more-->

To create species distribution models in R, first ensure that R and RStudio are installed on your computer. Additionally, R Markdown will be needed for creating your assignments. Please follow the linked learning resources below according to your level of expertise.
## First steps in R and RStudio

The online resources for this unit can be found [here](https://geomoer.github.io/moer-base-r/unit01/unit01-01_Intro.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Example: R Markdown with html output

## Working with spatial data in R
To work effectively with spatial data, particularly raster and vector data, it's essential to become familiar with the [**terra**]( https://cran.r-project.org/package=terra) and [**sf**]( https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) packages in R. These packages will be central to handling and analyzing spatial data throughout the course. Take some time to explore their basic functions and documentation.

The online resources for working with **vector data** can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-02_vector_data.html){:target="_blank"}.

The online resources for working with **raster data** can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-03_raster_data.html){:target="_blank"}.

Also work through the **example workflow**, which can be found [here]( https://geomoer.github.io/moer-bsc-project-seminar-SDM/unit03/unit03-05_example_SpatialDataProcessing.html){:target="_blank"}.

## Already a spatial data expert in R?
Fantastic! Since youâ€™re already familiar with the basics of spatial data in R, please consider assisting your peers with questions or code debugging as they work through the foundational exercises. If you still have time, explore advanced data visualization. There are many ways and many packages to do this here we will use the [**tidyterra** package]( https://dieghernan.github.io/tidyterra/). You can explore this in the optional exercise on the next page.
