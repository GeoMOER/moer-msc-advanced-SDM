## What is species distribution modeling?

Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) is a methodology used to estimate and predict the geographic distribution of species by correlating known occurrence records with environmental variables, such as temperature, precipitation, soil type, and land cover. SDMs help identify suitable habitats where species could potentially exist under various environmental conditions, providing a critical tool for ecology, conservation, and resource management.

SDMs go by several other names, which sometimes reflect slight differences in methodology or focus, including Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM), Habitat Suitability Modeling (HSM), Bioclimatic Envelope Modeling (BEM), and Environmental Niche Modeling. Although these terms may differ, they all refer to approaches aimed at estimating where a species is likely to occur based on its ecological requirements. This predictive capacity is especially valuable in a time of rapid environmental change, helping ecologists and conservationists make informed decisions.

## Why do we need species distribution modeling?

SDMs are increasingly used in fields where understanding species' potential distributions is critical. The main applications include:

Conservation and Management: SDMs allow researchers to identify areas that are essential for the survival of endangered or threatened species, informing habitat protection, restoration projects, and policy decisions. They also help to identify regions vulnerable to the spread of invasive species.
Climate Change Studies: As climate conditions continue to shift, SDMs are valuable for forecasting how speciesâ€™ ranges might expand, contract, or shift, providing a basis for planning adaptive conservation strategies.
Biodiversity and Biogeography Research: SDMs help scientists explore patterns in biodiversity, such as hotspots of species richness or endemism, and to estimate how these patterns might change over time.

For a deeper understanding, students could be assigned a foundational paper or recent review on SDM applications, illustrating the practical implications of these models in various contexts.



## Why is it problematic?

* jetzt paper

## maybe real live example here as in where it is used in german governmetn etc...

## Real live examples
Species distribution mdoelign is one of the tiopics that is not only very relevant to research but is also well established in consveration practice. There are numerous projects in gernmany on bundesbeene und federal stat ebene in which species distirbutiuon modeling is used. 
Here you have a small collection of projects it is used in/for:
Mopsmaps
