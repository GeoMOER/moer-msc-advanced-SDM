In this unit, we will create an artificial dataset to test species distribution modeling. You will learn how to construct artificial landscapes and create virtual species on them. Additionally, you will explore critical aspects of designing realistic species and sampling points in a manner suitable for testing species distribution models.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- Understand why variable selection is crucial for creating species distribution models.
- Create Neutral Landscape Models in R.
- Explain the purpose of virtual species and their advantages and disadvantages.
- Create virtual species in R.
- Transform probabilities of occurrence into presence-absence maps.
- Sample points realistically for testing species distribution models.
