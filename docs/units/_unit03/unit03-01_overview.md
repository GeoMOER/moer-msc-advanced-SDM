In this unit, you will generate artificial landscapes as environmental variables for SDM. You will learn how to construct **neutral landscape models (NLMs)** and explore designing of realistic environmental patterns. These artificial datasets will be used in the next unit to create virtual species.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this unit, you should be able to:

- understand the importance of selecting fitting variables in species distribution modeling,
- create **neutral landscape models (NLMs)** in R,
- and explore multicorrelinearity between environmental variables.
