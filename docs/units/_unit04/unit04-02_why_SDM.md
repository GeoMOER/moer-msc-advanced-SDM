Obviously, there are too many species on Earth to know them all, not to say their distributional ranges. 
To make things even more complicated, a _species_ does not exists physically but consists of _individuals_, which share characteristics according to a _species concept_.

This problem is known as the _Wallacean shortfall_ and the reason why we need SDM: we never can sample all individuals of a species (some exeptions of extremely rare species may exist, though) to know the actual distribution of a species, not to mention their dynamics through time. 



## Applicability of SDM

What can we do once the distribution of a single species or of a set of species is modelled?

There are plenty of opportunities and here are some of them:

* a species' range can be used for _descriptive purposes_ like assessing and monitoring species numbers and composition in a particular area,
* if we model the distribution from the occurrence of individuals of different steps in time, we can assess _changes of distribution ranges_ through time,
* if we know under which environmental conditions species do occur, we can predict the _suitability of habitats_ that are not occupied yet or find yet unknown populations,
* with SDM, it is possible to predict the occurrence of species under scenarios of climate change, what has direct relevance for _nature conservation_,
* stacking many predicted species' distributions together allows us to calculate the number of species - or _species richness_ - that occur in a particular area or grid cell, what is directly relevant for _biodiversity research_, 
* and last but not least, knowing the distribution ranges of species allows researchers to link characteristics of species with characteristics of the environment, what opens up a plethora of possibilities in scientific research to understand better the _functional significance of traits of species_, to understand better _why species occur in some places but not in others_, and ultimately to understand a bit better the _functional and phylogenetic diversity_ of life on Earth.
