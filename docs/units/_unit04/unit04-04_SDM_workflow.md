There are plenty of methods available for species distribution modelling. 
Here are the arguably most important ones, which will be introduced by the student tutorials:


| Method                           |  
|----------------------------------
|**Profile methods**               |
|Bioclim                           |
|Domain                            |
|**Regression methods**            |
|Generalized linear models         |
|Generalized additive models       |
|**Machine-learning methods**      |
|MaxEnt                            |
|Random forest                     |
|Boosted regression trees          |
|Neural networks                   |
|Support vector machines           |
