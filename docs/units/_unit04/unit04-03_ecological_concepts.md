There are some ecological concepts that are needed to interpret and critically evaluate SDM results, which are going to be discussed here.

Watch the following videos and answer the nasty questions below.
Write down a one-sentence answer for each question.

### Ecological niches and geographic distributions

<br>

### Fundamentals of species distribution modelling
{% include video id="tR9ofEXqqsE" provider="youtube" %}



## Questions


1. What is a species?

1. What is the difference between the fundamental and the realized niche?

1. How is geographical space related to niche space?

1. How can biotic interactions influence the distribution of species?

1. Why can dispersal be a problem for modelling the distribution of species?

1. And last but not least: How does Species Distribution Modelling work?

Note that you might need to search additional sources for answering the questions above.
