# Advanced Species Distribution Modeling

Species distribution modelling (SDM) is a key competence for ecogeographical research and applied nature conservation. It allows researchers to estimate current distributions of species and to also predict their future distributions under climate change scenarios. However, SDM is a dynamic field characterized by rapid advancements and many uncertainties.

This course will go beyond the basic SDM knowledge and will delve into all the small and very specific challenges it presents. Participants will gain ability in generating virtual species, critically evaluating the selection of environmental predictors, identifying knowledge gaps in the field, and independently constructing and fine-tune SDMs. The main focus of the course will be on generating an experimental research setup in which we will tackle some of the uncertainties.
